## Accounts to Create / Take Over

### 1. Anthropic (Claude API)
- **URL:** https://console.anthropic.com
- **What it's for:** Powers the email CMS
- **Cost:** Pay-per-use. At school update volume (~5-20 emails/month) expect < $1/month
- **Action:** Create account → Billing → Add payment method → API Keys → Create key
- **Env var:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### 2. GitHub
- **URL:** https://github.com/Mervil-Studio/Mervil-Catalyst
- **What it's for:** Source code + content storage. CMS commits JSON changes here
- **Action:** Transfer repo ownership to school's GitHub org, OR create a deploy bot account
- **Personal Access Token:** github.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic) → New token
  - Scopes needed: `repo` (full repo access)
  - Set expiration to "No expiration" or 1 year with a reminder to rotate
- **Env vars:** `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`

### 3. Netlify
- **URL:** https://app.netlify.com
- **What it's for:** Hosting + serverless functions + auto-deploy from GitHub
- **Cost:** Free tier is sufficient
- **Action:** Transfer site ownership to school's Netlify account
- **Env vars:** All secrets are set here (see below)

### 4. Behold.so (Instagram feed)
- **URL:** https://behold.so
- **What it's for:** Pulls @csrockets_cos Instagram posts into the Celebrations section
- **Cost:** Free tier (sufficient for this use)
- **Action:** Sign up → Connect Instagram @csrockets_cos → Create feed → Copy Feed ID
- **Where to paste it:** `components/CelebrationsSection.tsx` line 13: `const BEHOLD_FEED_ID = "YOUR_ID_HERE";`
- Then commit and push — site will show live Instagram feed within minutes

### 5. Email forwarding (for the CMS)
- **What it's for:** Forwards staff emails to the Netlify CMS function
- **Recommended:** Zapier (free tier works)
  - Trigger: "New Email" in Gmail (use a dedicated Gmail: updates@csrockets.org or similar)
  - Action: "Webhooks by Zapier" → POST
  - URL: `https://[your-netlify-site].netlify.app/.netlify/functions/cms-email`
  - Body (JSON):
    ```json
    {
      "from": "{{from_email}}",
      "subject": "{{subject}}",
      "body": "{{body_plain}}"
    }
    ```
  - Header: `x-cms-secret: [your CMS_WEBHOOK_SECRET value]`

## Netlify Environment Variables

Set all of these in: **Netlify dashboard → Site → Site configuration → Environment variables**

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `sk-ant-...` | From Anthropic console |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `ghp_...` | GitHub PAT with `repo` scope |
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | `Mervil-Studio` | GitHub org/user that owns the repo |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | `Mervil-Catalyst` | Repository name |

| `CMS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | any random string | Must match what Zapier sends in the `x-cms-secret` header |

---

## Content Files (what staff can update via email)

| File | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `data/announcements.json` | Site-wide announcement banner |
| `data/events.json` | Upcoming Open Houses / Info Nights section |
| `content/leadership.json` | Leadership team cards |
| `content/faculty.json` | Faculty cards |
| `content/board.json` | Board member cards |

All files are plain JSON — can also be edited directly in GitHub's web editor if needed.

## Google Calendar (School Calendar section)

The calendar section is built and styled but shows a placeholder until the embed URL is added.

1. Open Google Calendar → Settings → click your calendar name
2. Scroll to "Integrate calendar" → copy the `src` URL from the embed code
3. Open `components/CalendarSection.tsx`
4. Paste the URL into `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_EMBED_URL` (line ~17)
5. Optionally update `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_PUBLIC_URL` with the public link
6. Commit and push

---

## Theme System

The site has 4 pathway themes — visitors can switch between them.

| Theme ID | Colors | Pathway |
|---|---|---|
| `leadership` | Teal (CSST brand blue) | Leadership — **default** |
| `aerospace` | Deep space + green | Aerospace |
| `cyber` | Near-black + cyan | Cybersecurity |
| `entrepreneurship` | Warm white + orange | Entrepreneurship |

Default theme is set in:
- `app/globals.css` — `:root` block
- `app/theme-context.tsx` — `useState("leadership")`
- `app/layout.tsx` — FOUC-prevention inline script

---

## Deploying

Deploys are automatic. Any push to `main` on GitHub triggers a Netlify rebuild (~2 minutes).

To force a manual deploy: Netlify dashboard → Deploys → Trigger deploy.

---

## DNS / Domain Setup

To connect `csrockets.org` to Netlify:
1. Netlify → Site → Domain management → Add custom domain
2. Follow Netlify's DNS instructions (add A record or CNAME to your domain registrar)
3. Netlify handles SSL automatically via Let's Encrypt

---

## Development Setup (for future developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mervil-Studio/Mervil-Catalyst.git
cd Mervil-Catalyst
npm install
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

Node.js 18+ required.

## Replacing Placeholder Photos

All Unsplash placeholder images are marked with `caption="Placeholder · Replace with CSST student photos"` in `app/page.tsx`. To replace:

1. Upload real photos to `/public/` or an image host
2. Find the `<ImageBreak>` or `<img>` tags in the relevant component
3. Replace the `src` URL
4. Commit and push

For the student life grid (`CelebrationsSection`), once Behold.so is connected this happens automatically from Instagram posts.
